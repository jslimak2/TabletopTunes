- Games with clear mood or genre associations

#### Steps to add a board game:
1. Research the game's theme, mechanics, and atmosphere
2. Find 2-3 movie soundtracks that would match well
3. Explain why each soundtrack fits the game
4. Add specific track recommendations from each movie
5. Test your additions in the app

### 2. Improving the Matching Algorithm
Help make our soundtrack suggestions even better!

#### Areas for improvement:
- Theme detection accuracy
- Mood-based matching
- Game mechanic considerations
- Player count influences
- Session length considerations

### 3. Platform Features

#### Desktop (Electron) improvements:
- Native menu enhancements
- System integration features
- File system operations
- Better keyboard shortcuts

#### Android (Capacitor) improvements:
- Native device integrations
- Android-specific UI patterns
- Background audio handling
- Performance optimizations

### 4. UI/UX Enhancements

## üìù Adding Board Games

### Step 1: Research the Game
Before adding a game, research:
- **Theme**: Fantasy, Sci-Fi, Horror, Historical, Modern, etc.
- **Mood**: Tense, Relaxed, Epic, Mysterious, Fun, etc.
- **Mechanics**: Cooperative, Competitive, Worker Placement, etc.
- **Setting**: Time period, location, genre
- **Player Experience**: What emotions does the game evoke?

### Step 2: Find Matching Soundtracks
Look for movie soundtracks that match the game's:
- **Thematic elements** (fantasy game ‚Üí fantasy movie)
- **Emotional tone** (tense game ‚Üí suspenseful movie)
- **Setting/Period** (medieval game ‚Üí medieval movie)
- **Atmosphere** (spooky game ‚Üí horror movie)

### Step 3: Edit the Database
Open `game-soundtrack-data.js` and add your entry:

```javascript
'Your Game Name': {
    category: 'strategy', // strategy, adventure, horror, cooperative, etc.
    themes: ['keyword1', 'keyword2', 'theme3'], // Descriptive themes
    suggestedSoundtracks: [
        {
            movie: 'Movie Title',
            reason: 'Detailed explanation of why this soundtrack matches the game',
            tracks: ['Specific Track 1', 'Specific Track 2', 'Specific Track 3']
        },
        {
            movie: 'Another Movie',
            reason: 'Another explanation',
            tracks: ['Track A', 'Track B', 'Track C']
        },
        {
            movie: 'Third Movie Option',
            reason: 'Third explanation',
            tracks: ['Song 1', 'Song 2', 'Song 3']
        }
    ]
}
```

### Step 4: Test Your Addition
1. Save the file and refresh the app
2. Search for your game or click it if you added it to popular games
3. Verify the suggestions appear correctly
4. Check that the reasoning makes sense
5. Test clicking on individual tracks

### Example Entry
```javascript
'Azul': {
    category: 'abstract',
    themes: ['artistic', 'peaceful', 'mediterranean', 'beauty'],
    suggestedSoundtracks: [
        {
            movie: 'The Secret Garden',
            reason: 'Beautiful and artistic themes that match the elegant tile-laying gameplay',
            tracks: ['Main Title', 'The Garden', 'Roses']
        },
        {
            movie: 'Life of Pi',
            reason: 'Colorful and meditative atmosphere perfect for strategic thinking',
            tracks: ['Pi\'s Lullaby', 'God Storm', 'Anandi']
        },
        {
            movie: 'Am√©lie',
            reason: 'Whimsical and artistic French film matching the game\'s aesthetic beauty',
            tracks: ['Comptine d\'un autre √©t√©', 'La Valse d\'Am√©lie', 'Sur le fil']
        }
    ]
}
```
